What to Wear in Bosnia & Herzegovina

Layering is Key: 
    
    Bosnia and Herzegovina experiences varying temperatures throughout the year. Layering your clothing allows you to adapt to changing weather conditions. In colder months, opt for thermal layers under your outfits.Jeans are timeless and serve as a diverse foundation for your clothing. In the summer, pair them with cold layers like camisoles or a t-shirt, and in the winter, pair them with warmer layers like a long-sleeved shirt and sweater. However, if the summer temperature exceeds 40 degrees Celsius, you may want to choose a lighter weight cloth.

Quality Outerwear:

    Invest in a good-quality coat or jacket, especially for the winter season. Look for options that provide warmth without compromising on style. You can checkout some of the malls and shops in Sarajevo.


Blend Tradition with Modernity:

    Embrace traditional Bosnian clothing elements like the 'fes' (a traditional hat) or 'jelek' (waistcoat) and incorporate them into modern outfits for a unique look that reflects local culture.

Comfortable Footwear:

    Given the hilly terrain in parts of the country, comfortable and sturdy footwear, like boots or sneakers, is essential for daily wear. High heels may not be practical for all occasions. We love Hotter shoes because they are both comfortable and stylish. In winter you should get yourself a good pair of boots with soft rubber soles.
    It's critical to have soft rubber soles because even medium soles become extremely rigid in the freezing weather. making sure there is enough space between the tracks, or the snow will become trapped and making them very slippery.

Adapt to Seasonal Changes:
    
    Summers can be hot in Bosnia and Herzegovina, so lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton and linen are your best friends. Don't forget sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen for sun protection. Rain can be frequent, so investing in a good-quality umbrella and waterproof footwear is advisable, especially during the wetter seasons.

Respect for Religious Sites:

    When visiting religious sites like mosques, women should cover their heads with a scarf, and both men and women should wear modest clothing that covers their shoulders and knees. A pashmina is a versatile piece that will dress up any outfit for visiting religious sites.

Neutral Colors:
    
    Neutral colors like black, gray, and earth tones are popular and versatile, making it easy to mix and match clothing items.

Vintage and Secondhand Shopping:
    
    Explore vintage and secondhand stores for unique fashion finds. You might discover hidden gems that add character to your style.

Remember that fashion is subjective, and that everyone's unique style differs. The most important thing is to feel good in your clothes and to respect the region's cultural norms and traditions.

Bon Voyage!!!
