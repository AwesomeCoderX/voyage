Pizza is one of the most popular foods in the world, and Italy is its birthplace. With so many great pizzerias to choose from, it can be hard to know where to start. That's where this blog comes in. Best places to have pizza in Italy, not in any particular order(they are all great!!)

## L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele (Naples)

One of Naples' most venerable and exceptional pizzerias, Da Michele, has a storied history dating back to 1870. To maintain a cozy dining atmosphere, the restaurant provides numbered tickets to patrons. When it comes to choosing your pizza, the decision is a swift one, as Da Michele offers only two classic options: the marinara with tomato, oregano, and garlic, and the margherita featuring tomato and mozzarella.

The ancient Pizzeria Di Matteo represents an institution in the history of traditional Neapolitan pizza. The Di Matteo family has always been involved in this work. Years ago it was called “the pizzeria of the students” because it hosted young people from all over Italy for their studies in Naples , has become over time a fixed stop fundamental for national and foreign tourists.

The great Gino Sorbillo has locations in Naples, Milan and New York, so you’re never too far away from one of these simply perfect charred Neapolitan pizzas. Pizza toppings are designed around 10 Italian regions, so you can taste the speciality ingredients from across the country.

Dry do a modern take on the classic Italian pizzeria, with world class cocktails and slick service combined with pizzas that are simply delicious.


## Casa Manco (Rome)

[Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M33RpLkDGH8b5rB76){:target="_blank"}

Testaccio has one of the few markets in Rome where you can graze on prepared food (the others focus on selling ingredients rather than meals). Husband-and-wife team Paola Manco and Andrea Salabè opened Casa Manco there in 2017, and it quickly became one of the most appealing spots in a growing sea of dining options. 


## Antico Forno Roscioli (Rome)

[Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1ws8xCYd48Hojwcg9){:target="_blank"}

The super-central Antico Forno Roscioli isn’t actually as ancient as the name might suggest; the Roscioli family opened it in the 1970s. They dutifully make classic Roman baked goods, but the breads and cookies at the counter (however excellent) aren’t what draw thousands of customers daily


## Pizzeria Ostiense (Rome)

[Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KAf793FyVeBEAVBS8){:target="_blank"}

Pizzeria Ostiense serves matzo-thin, super crisp, wood-fired pizzas. The owners are Da Remo alumni and when they migrated to the Ostiense district from neighboring Testaccio, they left the snark behind them and instead focused on providing efficient, reasonable, and friendly service

_These are just a few of the many great places to eat pizza in Italy, so be sure to explore and find your own favorite!_
